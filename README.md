# ⚖️ Ledger-Core: Hardened SQL Accounting Engine

Ledger-Core is a high-performance, immutable double-entry ledger implemented entirely within PostgreSQL 18.

Unlike traditional applications that rely on middle-tier logic (Java/Python) to enforce financial rules, Ledger-Core moves the "Laws of Accounting" into the database schema itself. This ensures that even if a backend service has a bug, the ledger remains balanced, immutable, and audit-ready.

## 🛡️ The Four Pillars of Integrity

### Atomic Double-Entry Balancing: 
A DEFERRABLE constraint trigger ensures that no transaction can be committed unless the sum of Debits equals the sum of Credits.

### Strict Immutability: 
Triggers explicitly block UPDATE and DELETE operations on all financial records. To fix a mistake, you must post a reversing transaction—exactly like a real-world accounting book.

### The Wall of Integrity: 
A real-time balance cache is automatically verified against a "Ground Truth" calculation during every insert. If a discrepancy is detected (e.g., manual data tampering), the transaction is immediately aborted.

### Milestone Snapshots: 
Background jobs powered by pg_cron create periodic "checkpoints," keeping balance calculations O(1) for fast lookups while maintaining O(N) auditability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Docker and Docker Compose

PostgreSQL 18+ (Native support for modern UUIDs and Generated Columns)

pg_cron extension (Included in the provided Docker image)

### 1. Spin up the Environment

From the root directory, run:

````
Bash
docker-compose up -d
````

This initializes a PostgreSQL 18 container with pg_cron pre-configured to run on the ledger_db database.

### 2. Apply the Schema

The schema is organized as a series of Flyway-compatible migrations. Run them in order:

````
Bash
# Example using psql


cat db/migration/V1__*.sql db/migration/V2__*.sql db/migration/V3__*.sql \
    db/migration/V4__*.sql db/migration/V5__*.sql db/migration/V6__*.sql | \
    psql -h localhost -U admin -d ledger_db
````

### 3. Run the Integrity Test Suite

Verify that the engine's "defenses" are active by running the destructive test suite:

````
Bash
psql -h localhost -U admin -d ledger_db -f tests/integrity_suite.sql
````

You should see NOTICE logs confirming that the engine successfully blocked unbalanced entries and unauthorized deletions.

## 📂 Project Structure

#### db/migration/: 
Versioned SQL scripts defining tables, triggers, and procedures.

#### tests/: 
Pure SQL test suite to verify accounting rules.

#### docker-compose.yml: 
Local infrastructure configuration.

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive

### UUID v7 Primary Keys

We use UUID v7 for all primary keys. Unlike random UUIDs (v4), v7 is time-ordered. This provides the best of both worlds:

#### Global Uniqueness: 
Safe for distributed systems.

#### B-Tree Efficiency: 
New records are inserted at the end of the index, preventing index fragmentation and significantly speeding up writes.

### Milestone Architecture

To ensure the system scales to millions of entries, we use a snapshot pattern.

1. The Current Balance is stored in a cached table.

2. Every 10 minutes, a Milestone is saved.

3. When a new entry is posted, the system only calculates the "Delta" from the last milestone to verify the cache, ensuring the integrity check never slows down as the ledger grows.
